**Steps from Cost Function to Global Minimum**
  **Cost Function (Loss Function)**:

      The cost function quantifies the error between the predicted values and the actual values. Examples include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification.
**Gradient Descent**:

      Purpose: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function.
      Process: Iteratively adjusts the model parameters to reduce the cost function.
      Gradient Calculation: Computes the gradient (partial derivatives) of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
      Parameter Update: Updates parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient to reduce the cost function value. This is controlled by the learning rate.
      Convergence: The algorithm stops when it reaches a point where further adjustments do not significantly reduce the cost function. Ideally, this point is the global minimum.
**Global Minimum**:

      Definition: The point where the cost function reaches its lowest possible value over the entire parameter space.
      Role: Represents the optimal set of model parameters that minimize prediction error, leading to the most accurate model.
      How the Global Minimum Enhances Model Accuracy
**Optimal Parameters**:

      At the global minimum, the parameters (weights and biases) of the model are fine-tuned to minimize the cost function. This means the model predictions are as close as possible to the true values.
**Reduced Prediction Error**:

      Minimizing the cost function directly translates to minimizing the prediction error. The global minimum ensures that the sum of errors (or another measure of prediction quality) is as low as possible.
**Better Generalization**:

      A model that achieves the global minimum of the cost function on the training data is more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data. This is because it has found the best representation of the underlying data patterns, rather than fitting noise or outliers.
**Avoiding Local Minima**:

      Local minima can trap the optimization process, leading to suboptimal parameter values and higher prediction errors. Achieving the global minimum ensures that the model parameters are truly optimal.
